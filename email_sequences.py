I've got 2 spots left for {{industry}} companies looking to implement revenue automation.

Given {{company_name}}'s situation with {{pain_point}}, I think there's a strong fit.

The companies I work with typically see:
- 40-60% increase in qualified leads within 90 days
- 25-35% reduction in sales cycle time
- 200-300% ROI within 6 months

Quick win for you today.

Last month, I helped a client implement a simple lead scoring automation.

Takes 5 minutes to set up.
Resulted in 40% more qualified leads.

Here's exactly how to do it:

1. Score leads based on email engagement (+5 points for opens, +10 for clicks)
2. Add behavioral scoring (+15 for pricing page visits, +20 for demo requests)
3. Auto-assign leads scoring 50+ to your best sales rep

The automation runs 24/7 and ensures hot leads never slip through the cracks.
