## üìû Sales Scripts

### Discovery Call Script
```
**Opening (2 minutes)**
"Thanks for taking the time, [Name]. I know how valuable your time is. 

Based on our brief conversation, it sounds like [Company Name] is in a great growth phase. Before I share how we might help, I'd love to understand your current situation better.

**Discovery Questions (15 minutes)**

Current Process:
- How do you currently handle inbound inquiries from your website?
- What percentage of those turn into qualified sales opportunities?  
- How do you identify which prospects are worth immediate sales attention?

Pain Points:
- What's the biggest challenge with your current lead qualification process?
- How much time does your sales team spend on unqualified leads?
- What's your average cost to acquire a new customer?

Goals:
- If you could wave a magic wand, what would your ideal customer acquisition process look like?
- What would a 20% increase in qualified leads mean for your business?
- How important is reducing customer service costs while you scale?

**Transition to Solution (3 minutes)**
"Based on what you've shared, it sounds like you're experiencing the same challenges as many of our successful clients...

[Similar Company] had almost identical issues. They were growing 25% annually but their support costs were growing 50%. Sound familiar?

Here's exactly how we helped them..."

**Solution Presentation (10 minutes)**
[Use custom ROI calculator and case study relevant to their situation]

**Close (5 minutes)**
"Based on what you've told me about [Company Name], I believe we can help you achieve similar results.

The question is: Are you ready to turn your customer service into a revenue engine?

I'd recommend starting with our 30-day pilot program. This lets you see real results with minimal risk. If you don't see at least a 15% increase in qualified opportunities, we'll refund everything.

What questions do you have about moving forward?"
```

### Objection Handling Guide
```
**"We already have a CRM/support system"**
"That's great! Our platform integrates seamlessly with [their system]. We're not replacing what you have - we're making it 10x more powerful by adding AI that identifies revenue opportunities your current system can't see."

**"This seems expensive"**
"I understand the investment consideration. Let me put this in perspective: You mentioned you're spending about $X on customer acquisition. Our platform typically reduces that by 30-40% while increasing qualified leads. For a company your size, that usually means $Y in additional monthly revenue. The platform pays for itself in the first 60 days."

**"We need to think about it"**  
"Of course, this is an important decision. What specific concerns can I address for you right now? Is it about ROI, implementation complexity, or something else?

Here's what I can offer: Let's start with a limited 14-day pilot with just one of your lead sources. You'll see exactly how it works with your data, no commitment beyond that. Fair enough?"

**"We don't have time for implementation"**
"That's actually one of the main reasons companies choose us over building custom solutions. Our platform deploys in 48-72 hours, not months. You'll be seeing results by next week, not next quarter."

**"How do I know this will work for our industry?"**
"Great question. We work with companies in [their industry] including [Similar Company]. Each implementation is customized for industry-specific requirements. Would you like me to show you exactly how [Similar Company] achieved their results?"
```

## üìä ROI Calculator & Pricing Tools

### ROI Calculator Inputs
```javascript
// Lead Volume Analysis
const monthlyInquiries = [prospect_input];
const currentConversionRate = [prospect_input]; // %
const averageDealSize = [prospect_input]; // $
const salesCycleLength = [prospect_input]; // days
const supportCostPerInquiry = [prospect_input]; // $

// AI Platform Impact
const aiConversionBoost = 0.85; // 85% improvement
const dealSizeIncrease = 0.30; // 30% increase
const salesCycleReduction = 0.50; // 50% faster
const supportCostReduction = 0.60; // 60% reduction

// Calculations
const currentMonthlyRevenue = monthlyInquiries * (currentConversionRate/100) * averageDealSize;
const optimizedMonthlyRevenue = monthlyInquiries * (currentConversionRate/100 * aiConversionBoost) * (averageDealSize * (1 + dealSizeIncrease));
const revenueIncrease = optimizedMonthlyRevenue - currentMonthlyRevenue;
const costSavings = monthlyInquiries * supportCostPerInquiry * supportCostReduction;
const totalMonthlyBenefit = revenueIncrease + costSavings;
```

### Dynamic Pricing Logic
```javascript
// Tier Recommendations Based on Volume
const getTierRecommendation = (monthlyInquiries, annualRevenue) => {
  if (annualRevenue < 1000000) return "starter";
  if (monthlyInquiries < 2000) return "professional";
  if (monthlyInquiries < 10000) return "enterprise";
  return "custom";
};

// ROI-Based Pricing
const calculateROI = (monthlyBenefit, tierPrice) => {
  return ((monthlyBenefit * 12 - tierPrice * 12) / (tierPrice * 12)) * 100;
};

üö® Are you losing $50K+/month in hidden revenue opportunities?

Most growing companies are making this critical mistake:

They treat customer service as a cost center instead of a revenue engine.

Here's what's happening:
‚Üí 60% of sales inquiries get buried in support tickets
‚Üí High-value prospects wait days for responses  
‚Üí Unqualified leads consume sales team bandwidth
‚Üí No systematic approach to identify expansion opportunities

The companies winning in 2024 have figured out how to turn EVERY customer interaction into a revenue opportunity.

What's your current process for qualifying inbound inquiries?

   AI scores each prospect in under 30 seconds

2Ô∏è‚É£ **Route high-value opportunities instantly**
   Top prospects get immediate sales attention  

3Ô∏è‚É£ **Optimize pricing dynamically**
   AI recommends optimal pricing for maximum deal size

4Ô∏è‚É£ **Automate routine support**  
   60% cost reduction while improving satisfaction

Result: $2.3M additional revenue + $120K cost savings in 6 months.

The best part? It deployed in 72 hours, not 6 months.

üßµ How to increase revenue 20% without spending more on ads:

Turn your customer service into a revenue engine. Here's the playbook: 

1/8

Most companies treat support inquiries as problems to solve.

Smart companies see them as sales opportunities to capture.

The difference: $100K+ in additional monthly revenue.

2/8

The problem: 60% of sales inquiries get stuck in support queues.

By the time they reach sales, the prospect has already:
‚Ä¢ Gone cold  
‚Ä¢ Contacted competitors
‚Ä¢ Made a decision elsewhere

Time kills deals.

3/8

The solution: AI-powered lead qualification.

Every inquiry gets scored in real-time:
‚Ä¢ High-value prospects ‚Üí instant sales routing
‚Ä¢ Medium prospects ‚Üí automated nurturing  
‚Ä¢ Low-value inquiries ‚Üí self-service automation

4/8

Real example: SaaS company with 2,000 monthly inquiries.

Before AI: 85 qualified leads/month
After AI: 340 qualified leads/month  

Same traffic. 4x more opportunities.

$2.3M additional ARR in 6 months.

5/8

But wait, there's more.

AI also optimizes pricing in real-time:
‚Ä¢ Analyzes prospect's ability to pay
‚Ä¢ Recommends optimal price points
‚Ä¢ Increases average deal size 20-35%

Revenue optimization, not just lead qualification.

6/8

Implementation timeline:
‚Ä¢ Custom AI solution: 6-18 months
‚Ä¢ Our platform: 48-72 hours

No development required.
Plug-and-play with existing systems.

7/8

Results our clients see:
‚úÖ 15-40% revenue increase
‚úÖ 60% support cost reduction  
‚úÖ 30% higher deal sizes
‚úÖ 50% faster sales cycles

ROI typically 300-500% in year one.
