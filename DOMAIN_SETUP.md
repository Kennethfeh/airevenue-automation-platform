# Domain Setup Guide: flowsupportai.com

## âœ… Configuration Complete

## ðŸ“‹ Next Steps

### 1. Deploy to Vercel (Recommended)

```bash

#### In Vercel Dashboard:
1. Go to your project settings
2. Click "Domains" 
3. Add "flowsupportai.com"
4. Vercel will show you DNS records to configure

#### In Your Domain Registrar (GoDaddy, Namecheap, etc.):
Add these DNS records:

```
Type: A
Name: @
Value: 76.76.19.61

Type: CNAME
Name: www
Value: cname.vercel-dns.com
```

### 3. Alternative: Deploy to Netlify

```bash
# Install Netlify CLI
npm i -g netlify-cli

# Build and deploy
npm run build
netlify deploy --prod --dir=out
```

Then add your domain in Netlify's dashboard.
